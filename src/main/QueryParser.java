     *           AND m IN secondPathView RETURN ...
     *   - This query means that while n must be a node contained within paths inside myPathView, we are interested in a
     *       general query over the whole graph database, but we want to begin with only nodes n,m inside myPathView and
     *       secondPathView. The two views used do not necessarily need to be path views; they can be node views as well.
     *       However this is supported with path views as well for added flexibility, since sometimes a user may want
     *       a generalized view that can be used for multiple purposes.
