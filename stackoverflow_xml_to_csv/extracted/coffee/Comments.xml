However I was more thinking of immersion techniques where you don't add more water by the second or a fixed pour over recipe where over extraction would rather occur if your grind is too fine and the grounds steep too long in the water. In these cases the acidity will not be much different and the coffee in general would be more concentrated, as more solubles are dissolved in the water.

If you had a weak pump and used that to make espresso, water would barely escape the basket (assuming an espresso grind size and a good tamp) because the grind size and the tamp literally restrict the flow of water. Actually you'd almost definitely burn out the pump since it would try to push water that can't be pushed. If you use a coarser grind / no tamp to compensate for a weak pump, you'll still get coffee. It just won't be espresso. (Like Aeropress.)" CreationDate="2021-08-03T23:11:22.100" UserId="7963" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

So when you have a bag that holds 3 portions, you can open it and use up one portion immediately but then the other two portions will be exposed to moisture for a longer time. As such, I think grinding frozen beans should only be recommended when you're packing them in individual portions.
